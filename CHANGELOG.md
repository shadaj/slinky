+ Components and external components with a `Props` type of `Unit` can now be constructed without any parameters, instead of having to pass in `()` as props [PR #12](https://github.com/shadaj/slinky/pull/12)
+ Boolean attributes, such as `disabled`, can now be used without specifying a value to closer match JSX. For example, a disabled input can now be constructed as `input(disabled)` without providing the `:= true` [PR #14](https://github.com/shadaj/slinky/pull/14)
