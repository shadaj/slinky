### Breaking Changes :warning:
+ The tags API has seen some major changes, please take a look at the separate section below for more details [PR #243](https://github.com/shadaj/slinky/pull/243)
+ Half-built components and tags, which have some props provided but have not yet been converted to a `ReactElement`, cannot be reused. Doing this will result in a runtime exception pointing out where the reuse occured [PR #253](https://github.com/shadaj/slinky/pull/253)
+ Components using the static lifecycle functions `getDerivedStateFromProps` and `getDerivedStateFromError` must now override the functions with a `val` [PR #248](https://github.com/shadaj/slinky/pull/248)
+ The `React.forwardRef` function now takes a `FunctionalComponentTakingRef`, which can be creating by creating a functional component that takes an additional ref parameter: `FunctionalComponent((props, ref) => ...)` [PR #227](https://github.com/shadaj/slinky/pull/227)
+ The `ReactRef` type is no longer variant in its type parameters to increase type safety [PR #227](https://github.com/shadaj/slinky/pull/227)
+ Components will no longer have their `displayName` when built in `fullOptJS` mode, this results in a **~2.5% decrease in bundle size** and matches behavior with JS where names are obfuscated in production builds  [PR #217](https://github.com/shadaj/slinky/pull/217)
+ The `Option` writer now emits `null` instead of `js.undefined` for a value of `None` [PR #247](https://github.com/shadaj/slinky/pull/247)

### Bug Fixes
+ Make the static lifecycle functions `getDerivedStateFromProps` and `getDerivedStateFromError` work correctly in `fullOptJS` mode [PR #248](https://github.com/shadaj/slinky/pull/248)
+ Fix issues around state not updating when setting an `Option` to `None` in hot reloading mode [PR #247](https://github.com/shadaj/slinky/pull/247)
+ Handle `null` return values in derived state functions to not update the state [PR #249](https://github.com/shadaj/slinky/pull/249)
+ Fix the `js.|` reader/writer implementations to work correctly in `fullOptJS` mode [PR #248](https://github.com/shadaj/slinky/pull/248)
+ Support autoComplete attr for input and form elements [PR #225](https://github.com/shadaj/slinky/pull/225)
+ Fix capitalization of `rowSpan`/`colSpan` attribute (used to be `rowspan`/`colspan`) [PR #224](https://github.com/shadaj/slinky/pull/224)

### Tags API Changes
This release includes a major rewrite of the tags API that eliminates the need to cast the `target` value of event handlers and improves typesafety by more closely matching the official React API. As a result of these changes, event handlers defined in separate methods or code abstracting over tags may not initially compile with this new version.

#### Event Handlers
Event handlers in previous versions of Slinky were functions from a DOM event type to `Unit`. In React, events are normalized into `SyntheticEvent`s that provide a common subset of the events generated in different browsers. In this version of Slinky, event handlers have been changed to all be functions from a synthetic event type (one of `SyntheticEvent[TargetDOMType, UnderlyingDOMEventType]`, `SyntheticMouseEvent[TargetDOMType]`, `SyntheticTouchEvent[TargetDOMType]`, etc based on the event being listened to) to `Unit`. 

This means that explicit references to the DOM event type will no longer compile and will need to be replaced by an appropriate synthetic event type with a `TargetDOMType` that matches the DOM type of the tag the listener is being placed on. This change ensures that the properties available on event objects at compile time match those generated by React.

#### Abstracting over Tags
In previous versions of Slinky, passing in attributes required the first attribute to be passed separately from the varargs parameter containing the rest of the attributes. In this version, the API for constructing tags has changed from `apply` taking either `(firstTag: AttrPair[...], otherTags: AttrPair[...]*)` or `ReactElement*` to just a single method taking `(mods: TagMod[...]*)` with conversions from `AttrPair` and `ReactElement` to this type.

So code that passed in generated attributes like:

```scala
div(firstAttr, restAttrs: _*)
```

will now need to be replaced by

```scala
div(allAttrs: _*)
```

Similarly, in components that previously took in `AttrPair` and `ReactElement` separately, this can now be simplified to just take `TagMod`s.

+ **BREAKING**: Instead of taking key and refs as additional parameters next to props, they are now taken in through the methods `withKey` and `withRef` (components and external components only)
+ **BREAKING**: Introduce the experimental macro annotation `@react` to simplify component and external component creation with auto-generated companion object for a component class (or external component object). This is a major change to how applications with Slinky are written, so please see the notes at the end of the changelog [PR #29](https://github.com/shadaj/slinky/pull/29)
  + **BREAKING**: This change also renames the `Component` class to `ComponentWrapper`. The `Component` class is now used for the `@react` annotation.

### `@react` macro annotation (experimental)
One of Slinky's main goals is to have React components written in Scala look very similar to ES6. In version 0.1.x, Slinky required
extra boilerplate for defining an object that contained `apply` methods and then creating a `Def` inner class that contained the actual component logic.

This version includes the `@react` macro annotation, which makes it possible to directly write the class containing component logic and have Slinky generate
the companion object for constructing component instances. The macro annotation also now generates special `apply` methods when your Props is a case class
so that constructing Scala components looks more similar to JSX, with the Props values directly taken as parameters of the `apply`.

Note that the macro annotation is **experimental** and **not required**. To use the original component style simply replace the `extends Component` with `extends ComponentWrapper` and your
components should continue to function as they did before.

As an example of migrating an existing component to the new macro annotation style, take a simple component that displays a header:
```scala
import me.shadaj.slinky.core.WrapperComponent
import me.shadaj.slinky.web.html._

object HelloMessage extends WrapperComponent {
  case class Props(name: String)
  type State = Unit

  @ScalaJSDefined
  class Def(jsProps: js.Object) extends Definition(jsProps) {
    def render() = {
      div(s"Hello ${props.name}")
    }
  }
}
``` 

to use the new macro annotation style, we essentially extract out the definition class, move the `Props` and `State` types into the class, and extend `Component` instead of `Definition`:
```scala
import me.shadaj.core.{Component, react}
import me.shadaj.slinky.web.html._

@react class HelloMessage extends Component {
  case class Props(name: String)
  type State = Unit
  
  def render() = {
    div(s"Hello ${props.name}")
  }
}
```

If we want to use this component, we now have a new option for constructing it directly passing in the Props values
```scala
HelloMessage(HelloMessage.Props("Shadaj")) // old style
HelloMessage("Shadaj") // now possible!
HelloMessage(name = "Shadaj") // now possible, closest to JSX
```

The `@react` annotation is also available for external components. For external components, the annotation generates the new `apply` method style in the same style as Scala components.
```scala
import me.shadaj.slinky.core.annotations.react
import me.shadaj.slinky.core.ExternalComponent

@react object React3 extends ExternalComponent {
  case class Props(mainCamera: String, width: Int, height: Int,
                   onAnimate: Option[() => Unit] = None, alpha: Boolean = false)

  override val component: js.Object = js.Dynamic.global.React3.asInstanceOf[js.Object]
}
```

this makes it possible to construct the external component as
```scala
React3(mainCamera = "camera", width = 800, height = 800)
```

## v0.1.1
+ Have ExternalComponentsWithTagMods take the tag type as a type parameter instead of an abstract type [PR #19](https://github.com/shadaj/slinky/pull/19)
+ Added support for reading and writing values of type `js.UndefOr[T]` [PR #18](https://github.com/shadaj/slinky/pull/18)
+ Components and external components with a `Props` type of `Unit` can now be constructed without any parameters, instead of having to pass in `()` as props [PR #12](https://github.com/shadaj/slinky/pull/12)
+ Boolean attributes, such as `disabled`, can now be used without specifying a value to closer match JSX. For example, a disabled input can now be constructed as `input(disabled)` without providing the `:= true` [PR #14](https://github.com/shadaj/slinky/pull/14)

## v0.1.0
+ Initial release
