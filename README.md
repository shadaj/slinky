## What is Slinky?
Slinky is a framework for writing React apps in Scala with an experience just like using ES6.

Slinky lets you:
+ Write React components in Scala with an API that mirrors vanilla React
+ Implement interfaces to other React libraries with automatic conversions between Scala and JS types
+ Write apps for React Native and React 360, including the ability to share code with web apps
+ Develop apps iteratively with included hot-reloading support

## Contributing
Slinky is split up into several submodules:
+ `core` contains the React.js facades and APIs for creating components and interfaces to external components
+ `web` contains bindings to React DOM and definitions for the HTML/SVG tag API
+ `reactrouter` contains bindings to React Router
+ `history` contains a facade for the HTML5 history API
+ `native` contains bindings to React Native and external component definitions for native UI elements
+ `vr` contains bindings to React 360 and external component definitions for VR UI elements
+ `readWrite` contains the `Reader` and `Writer` typeclasses used to persist state for hot reloading
+ `hot` contains the entrypoint for enabling hot-reloading
+ `scalajsReactInterop` implements automatic conversions between Slinky and Scala.js React types
+ `testRenderer` contains bindings to `react-test-renderer` for unit testing components
+ `coreIntellijSupport` contains IntelliJ-specific support for the `@react` macro annotation
+ `tests` contains the unit tests for the above modules (except native and vr which have local tests)
+ `docs` and `docsMacros` contains the documentation site, which is a Slinky app itself

To run the main unit tests, run `sbt tests/test`.
